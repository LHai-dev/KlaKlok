# KlaKlok Project 🎲💰

## Overview
The **KlaKlok Project** is a fun and interactive dice-based betting game developed as a team project. The game allows multiple players to place bets on different outcomes of dice rolls. The game tracks each player's bets, wins, and losses, and also calculates the boss's (house's) total winnings and losses. The boss's results are displayed when the application exits.

This project was developed by a team of four members, each contributing their skills and expertise to create a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.
